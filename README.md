# Important Data Structure
## Array
   - Sort an array containing 0’s, 1’s and 2’s (Dutch National Flag Problem)
   - Find the smallest window in array sorting which will make the entire array sorted
   - Find a duplicate element in a limited range array
   - Find the maximum length sub-array having an equal number of 0’s and 1’s
   - Sort an array containing 0’s, 1’s and 2’s (Dutch National Flag Problem)
   - Rearrange the array such that it contains positive and negative numbers at alternate positions
   - Sort elements by their frequency and Index
## List
## Stack
## Queue
## Tree
### Tree traversal
   - In order, pre-order, post order
   - DFS, BFS

### QuadTree
### AVL Tree

## Heap
   - Priority Queue
     - Find K’th largest element in an array
     - Sort a K-Sorted Array
     - Merge M-sorted lists of variable length
## Graph
   - DFS
   - BFS

## String
   - String matching

# Important Algorithm
## Search Algorithm
## Sort Algorithm
## Divide & Conquer
## Greedy
## Dynamic Programming
### Classic Dynamic Programming
- Longest common subsequence
- Longest increasing subsequence
- Edit distance
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- 0-1 Knapsack
### Advance Dynamic Programming
## Backtracking
   - Print all possible solutions to N Queens Problem
   - Find all Permutations of a given string
   - All combinations of elements satisfying given constraints
   - Find the path from source to destination in a matrix that satisfies given constraints
## Branch and Bound Algorithm
   - Branch and Bound can solve many optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem, Knapsack Problem, and many others.
## Randomized Algorithm
   - Quick Sort - the fastest solution involves randomized.
## Math

   - Primes, GCD & LCM
- Geometry and Trigonometry
- permutations & combinations
- Bases
  - Binary to Dec
  - Hex to Dec
  - etc
